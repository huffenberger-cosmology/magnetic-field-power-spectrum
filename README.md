# magnetic-field-power-spectrum

Tools to generate magnetic fields with specified power spectra in 3d boxes, and to evaluate the power spectra of those boxes.

## Installation

This code should work in python 3.x but probably not in python 2.x because of the difference in the C API.

python setup.py install --user
